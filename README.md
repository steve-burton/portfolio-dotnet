# Portfolio

#### March 3, 2017

### By **Steve Burton**

### Specifications
This is a project to create a personal portfolio website using the Github API to find my most-starred repos.


## Setup/Installation Requirements

Clone this repository and open it in Visual Studio.

If you wish, you can add add a file with a GitHub API key, though it isn't necessary for the app to run, or to find my starred projects.

To do so, create the file: Models/EnvironmentVariables.cs

The contents should look like this:

```
namespace PortfolioDotnet.Models
{
    public static class EnvironmentVariables
    {
        public static string ClientId = "Replace this string with your 'Client Id' from GitHub";
        public static string ClientSecret = "Replace this string with your 'Client Secret' from GitHub";
    }
}

```

To run the program in VisualStudio, press the play button and view in your web browser.
